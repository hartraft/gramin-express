## Why should you care about Gramin Express?

So you have a shiny Garmin device and you like sharing your rides, runs or any
other activities on [Strava](http://strava.com). You might run into the following
problems:

- You don't like [Garmin Express](http://software.garmin.com/en-US/express.html)
- You think [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) is a joke
- Neither of those but you have a "non-sport" device, eg. an Oregon which is
  often used by mountain bikers. However these devices do not seem to have
  support for automatic upload to Garmin Connect<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup> Even Garmin is confused whether these devices are suported or not, see [here](https://connect.garmin.com/api/content/page/help/start/devices.faces?actionMethod=api%2Fcontent%2Fpage%2Fhelp%2Fstart%2Fdevices.xhtml%3AuserSwitcher.switchSystem&cid=663158) and [here](https://connect.garmin.com/api/content/page/help/faq.faces?cid=507967#gettingStarted).

If you want something that simply works with your device, Gramin Express for the rescue. Here is how it works:

- Connect your device via USB
- Start Gramin Connect
- Click "Upload"
- Profit
